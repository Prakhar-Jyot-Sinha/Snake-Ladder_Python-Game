    " \n",
    "- There are 6 face dice which are being rolled by the player to their\n",

    "- The player starts from 0 and has to reach the final position (in our case,\n",
    "  it's 100).\n",

    "- There are some ladders which turn out to be lucky for the player as\n",
    "  they shorten the way.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- There are some snakes present in between the game which turns out\n",
    "  to be the enemy of the player as they just lengthen their way to 100.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- The position of snakes and ladders are stored in start:end format\n",
    "  where start denotes the position of ladder/snake and end denotes the\n",
    "  value that it reaches.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- There are only 2 players in the game and no spectators \n",
    "\n",
    "- During any playerâ€™s chance, if he/she enters `quit`, then\n",
    "  the game will instantaneously end for that particular player and the other\n",
    "  player will win the game.\n",
